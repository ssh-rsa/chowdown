tags: desserts

ingredients:
- 3 8oz blocks cream cheese, softened
- 1 15 can pumpkin puree
- 4 large eggs
- 150g granulated sugar (3/4 US cup)
- 100g packed brown sugar (1/2 US cup)
- 61g sour cream (1/4 US Cup)
- 2tsp vanilla extract
- 2tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1tsp pumpkin pie spice
- 1/2tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/4tsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg (or fresh ground)
- 1/4tsp ground cloves
- 24 whole oreos
- 6tbsp butter(melted), plus more for greasing pan

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C)
- In a food processor, chop oreos until crumbly
- Pour butter into food processor, then mix until just combined.
- Pour into heavily greased 9" springform pan and press to the bottom and a tiny bit up the sides. Try to get it as even as possible.
- Double wrap the pan in aluminum foil and get it as sealed as you can, make sure the foil goes above the pan walls.
- In a large mixing bowl (or stand mixer,) with a hand mixer, cream together cream cheese, sugar, and brown sugar until smooth.
- Add sour cream, pumpkin, salt, flour, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, vanilla extract, ground cloves, and nutmeg until well combined.
- Add in eggs, one at a time, mixing after each one.
- Pour cheesecake mixture over the oreo crust.
- Place springform pan in a baking/roasting tray and pour boining water into the tray, until it reaches about halfway up the sides of the pan. (This is a water bath to prevent cracking, alternatively just place it on a baking sheet.)
- Place on center rack in oven and bake until jiggly, 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minutes.
- Turn the oven off, and prop door open, allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for at least an hour, then move to fridge to chill overnight.
- Take out of pan and enjoy!

This is a fun recipe I originally got from [https://www.delish.com/cooking/recipe-ideas/recipes/a50173/chocolate-pumpkin-cheesecake-recipe/](Delish). I added fresh nutmeg and water bath instructions, but even with the water bath it sometimes comes out with a crack or two (I'm not perfect!) I usually make this cheesecake only once/twice a year and it's a big hit every time!
